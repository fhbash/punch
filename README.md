# rempointer

The Auto Remote Punch Clock

Have you being forced to punch the clock and constantly submit time sheets?  
**COMPLAIN NO MORE!** Remote Pointer is here to help you on keeping the schedule in the grunt work factory :wink:

# Usage

- Punching the Clock using the current time

```shell
chmod +x ./rempointer.sh
rempointer.sh -u email -p password
```

_at the moment rempointer only offers support to punch the clock using the dimep
kairos system, if you use other system please submit a PR, we are very
interested in extending rempointer to other time sheet systems_
